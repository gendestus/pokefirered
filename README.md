# Ultimate Pokemon

This is my custom ruleset for FireRed. For the most part, it's a bunch of small world tweaks and some hooks for AI.

Features
- Adds a starter pokeball variable to easily change Oak's Lab
- Allows you to skip that awful old man tutorial
- All wild pokemon are first forms (except babies)
    - (This is an aesthetic choice. It never made sense as a kid that there were evolved pokemon in the wild at all)
    - To compensate, evolved battle xp (from trainers) is increased
- Talking to Oak's last pokeball unlocks national dex
- $500 Magikarp replaced with Feebas
- Redone Trainer lineups to make them more engaging
- [TODO] Coins from Rocket Members because I hate the gambling game
- XP from catches
- IV Check during battle
- Every poke has a held item
- Run & Bike everywhere
- Increased shiny odds to 10%
